    <h1>Role of Advanced Software Platforms in THE LIZ Automotive Industry</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Control Program and Operating Systems</h2>
        <p>All automotive ECUs need a control program to manage several other programs that control the hardware components and applications of each ECU. The Automotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR) is one such platform that has been built by the automotive industry collaboration.  AUTOSAR is a layered software architecture for ECU applications that uses standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). It also has a hardware-agnostic interface to the majority of automotive microprocessor architectures. Many organizations follow AUTOSAR, the automotive industry’s most popular compliance, for their ECU software/firmware development.</p>
        <p>However, AUTOSAR cannot manage the ECUs that include massive, complicated software codes, such as infotainment systems, telematics, and ADAS applications. This led to the development of OS, a high-tech platform that has significantly impacted the automotive industry. Some safety-critical ECUs require an operating system with certifications like ISO 26262that no Linux versions presently have. So, QNX, Green Hills, and similar operating systems with safety certification are preferred over Linux.</p>
        
        <h2>Hypervisor OS</h2>
        <p>A hypervisor, also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor or VMM, is a type of hardware virtualization that enables many guests operating systems to run on a single host system concurrently. The guest OS emulates its processor, memory, and other hardware resources, by using the host computer’s hardware. The computer can share its memory, thanks to the hypervisor program installed on it.</p>
        <p>The following are the two types of hypervisors:</p>
        <p>Type 1 hypervisor functions as a light operating system that runs directly on the host’s hardware, whereas type 2 works as a software overlay on top of an operating system.</p>
        <p>The best two examples that show the advantages of a Hypervisor are –</p>
        <p>First, the backup monitor is a safety-critical system that is now a must for all new vehicles sold in the United States. Second, the infotainment system monitor is sufficient for a backup display, however, it cannot be used with a Linux OS as it lacks safety-critical clearance.</p>
        <p>The alternative is to use a hypervisor that combines Linux with QNX, Green Hills OS, or any other safety-certified operating system. Another scenario where a hypervisor can be useful is the convergence of the instrument cluster and the infotainment system.</p>
        
        <h2>Telematics Systems</h2>
        <p>The Telematics systems include an embedded software platform that communicates with a SaaS platform to deliver the telematics services. There are multiple telematics solutions in the market which run on different operating systems, but QNX is one of the prominent choices for OS in telematics system.</p>
        <p>Most of the top Tier 1 suppliers in the market provide telematics software and hardware systems as it is one of the key elements of vehicle dynamics which provides important insights on navigation, driving analysis, engine health monitoring, and many more.</p>
        
        <h2>Infotainment Systems</h2>
        <p>High-end infotainment systems are the most complex automotive software systems, which are currently mass-produced. Typical to such systems are the complex display systems with audio entertainment, navigation systems, and numerous applications. When available, there are links to the telematics systems, the instrument cluster, and the head-up display.</p>
        <p>The driver or passenger can control and interact with the infotainment system through an extensive Human Machine Interface (HMI). There is also a connection between the smartphone app integration software platform and the Virtual Private Assistant software, both of which are covered in the following sections.</p>
        <p>This shows how different software platforms are integrated into or linked to the infotainment system. The Operating System (OS) is the main software platform that controls all the infotainment-related software, directly or indirectly.</p>
    
        <h2>Smartphone Apps Integration</h2>
        <p>A smartphone has become an essential part of a driver’s daily routine. A majority of drivers are more likely to use mobile applications for infotainment to reduce distraction. Some OEMs have created their own software platforms to integrate smartphone apps. However, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto have been more successful than other models. Many infotainment systems support both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto that makes them compliant with most smartphones in the market.</p>
        <p>The two main factors for the popularity of both the platforms are — better user interface familiarity and multiple vehicle-centric apps. On the contrary, the iPhone and Android smartphones apps, do not work as CarPlay or Android Auto apps. Google maps, traffic information, news, audiobooks, podcasts, music, calendar, and messages are the most popular apps among all.</p>
    

        <h1>Advantages of THE LIZ Automotive Software </h1>
        <p>Software platforms offer numerous benefits that increase in tandem with the growth of the ecosystem surrounding each platform. Most of these benefits come from the conventional concepts of re-usable and updateable building blocks. A few benefits of the software platform are listed below:</p>
        <p>Improved Reliability – Each new version of the software platform improves code reliability. This is due to the fact that most of the existing code can be reused, and only a small part of the new code needs to be written.</p>
        <p>Bug Detection and Correction – With only minor code being written afresh, finding bugs and fixing them becomes quite simple</p>
        <p>Cost-Effective – The cost of reusing a software platform is lower that makes it economical to use.</p>
        <p>Shorter Time to Market – Reusing the same software platform accelerates the time to market.</p>

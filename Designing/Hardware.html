    <h1>Role of Advanced Hardware Platforms in THE LIZ Automotive Industry</h1>
    <p> The design specifications are often tweaked to make them an automotive grade and let them easily handle the vehicle’s temperature and vibration levels. Due to the intricacies of the operating environment and use cases, automotive electronics have to be more electromagnetic interference resistant than pocket devices. However, silicon is just a part of the solution, it being a piece of highly engineered sand sans supporting software.
        The lines of code quickly multiply in modern vehicles as hundreds of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) regulate everything from fuel supply to battery charge management to climate control. Traditionally, each ECU has its set of chips and peripheral devices, all of which operate on their driver code.

        <h2>Advanced Hardware Platforms in the Automotive Industry</h2>
        <h2>NXP S32</h2>
        <p>NXP has launched a new processor range that keeps the company competitive in the new mobility environment by providing better efficiency, reducing energy consumption, and minimizing software development efforts.</p>
        <h2>What is the purpose of the S32 automotive processing platform?</h2>
        <p>Vehicles are expected to become more electrified, connected, and automated than ever before in the coming years, and some fundamental changes are anticipated in the automotive electronic architecture. As more data is created by the sensors, is exported to the cloud, and is consumed through various services, vehicles now require new computational capabilities. To cater to this requirement, NXP has developed the S32 processing platform.
            S32 microcontrollers and microprocessors are designed to combine performance and power efficiency for automotive and industrial applications. A series of scalable 32-bit MCUs have been developed for the automotive body, zone control, and electrification applications to tackle the current and future connectivity, security, and safety challenges.
        </p>
        
            <p>Provides 10 times better performance than the currently available platforms.</p>
            <p>Lowers the software development lifecycle by 90% across application domains and above 40% overall.</p>
            <p>Delivers all-new levels of automotive safety and Over-the-Air (OTA)</p>
        
        <h2>What are the benefits of using the S32 automotive processing platform?</h2>
        <p>The S32 platform helps maintain multiple firmware versions. By allowing memory flexibility, the platform enables the software to roll back to its good version, hence, it lowers the risk of installation failure. It is used to process service-oriented gateway applications, safety co-processors, and domain controllers.</p>
        <p>For the S32 chip line-up, the company leverages its design commonality to provide scalable software solutions that complement the hardware. According to NXP, engineers can reuse up to 90% of the low-level code across each ECU by using the S32 chips in the vehicle</p>
        <p>Besides saving on time, reusability means that most of the testing and validation, including security testing, that has already been done on one application, can be applied on other applications.
            The company claims that the new chip is up to ten times faster than today’s fastest processors. If the processors are power effective, there is no reason that these high-end chips cannot be combined with Intel FPGAs, Nvidia GPUs, or one of Mobileye’s EyeQ4/5 chips to handle AI functionality in an ECU.
        </p>
        <h2>Why the NXP S32 Architecture was required?</h2>
        <p>NXP S32 has a scalable architecture that can handle a wide range of performance levels, from a low-power core Arm® Cortex®-M to high-performance Cortex-A. Having a scalable option for a processor’s core enhances the product’s life cycle while also making the feature enhancements and reductions easier. Also, all these Arm cores- M, R, and A come with the highest level of functional safety capabilities i.e Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) D. Over-the-Air Updates – The S32 platform, through a secure gateway and a common domain architecture, offers zero-downtime, and the OTA functionality with full roll-back options to all the supported vehicle domains.</p>
        <p>Each microcontroller has application-specific IP that provides customized hardware support for the key domain requirements such as secure gateway, powertrain, radar, and motor control.</p>

        <h2>Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit (Qualcomm)</h2>
        <p>Qualcomm launched a new auto platform – Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit that leverages artificial intelligence for in-vehicle virtual assistance, safety, and driver interfaces. The company, through its collaboration with Amazon, has integrated the Alexa Automotive Software Development Kit (SDK) into the new platform to create a customized version of Alexa for an in-vehicle intelligent assistant.</p>
    
        <h2>NVIDIA DRIVE</h2>
        <p>DRIVE AGX (In-Vehicle AI Computer): This Developer Kit includes all hardware, software, and sample applications required to build production-ready autonomous vehicles (AV).</p>
        <p>DRIVE Hyperion (Car Reference Architecture): It is a reference architecture for NVIDIA’s Level 2+ autonomy solution, which comprises a full sensor suite, AI computing platform, and the full software stack for autonomous driving, driver control, and visualization. The kit can be installed in a test vehicle that allows the AV developers to test, analyze, and validate the AV technology.</p>
        <p>DRIVE Sim (End to End simulation platform): It is a complete simulation platform designed from the ground up to run large-scale, physically accurate multi-sensor simulations. This free, scalable, and modular platform supports AV development and validation from concept to implementation, boosts developer efficiency and speeds up the time to market.</p>

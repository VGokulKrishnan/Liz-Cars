    <h1>What Are THE LIZZ Cars Made Of?</h1>
    <h2>The Top Materials Used In THE LIZMOTORS Auto Manufacturing</h2>
    <p>Do you know that having a car made from the most efficient materials will help in fuel consumption while still provide the necessary safety features? There is a lot of planning, design, and science put into developing a car. There are different types of materials used to design a car, and these materials determine the durability, design, and sometimes the speed of the vehicle.</p>
    <div class="content">

        <h2>1.Steel</h2>
        <p> Different parts and areas of a car need different types of steel. Steel is the main materials in manufacturing door panels, the chassis of the car, and the support beams. It is also used in exhaust pipes and mufflers in the car.it is mostly used on the frame of the car because of its strength. This means that it has a better ability to absorb impact. The average car contains 2400 pounds of steel.</p>
    
        <h2>2.Aluminum</h2>
        <p>Among other metals, the light-weight and durability of Aluminum make it perfect for specific car parts. It is also malleable, making it a common material in car production.The wheels, which are essential parts, are made of aluminum, replacing steel. Most engine blocks are also made of steel even. Though it is not quite as durable as iron, it is lighter, and this boosts performance.</p>

        <h2>3.Fiberglass</h2>
        <p>Fiberglass is made of small thin strands of glass. It is mostly air and not glass. When the glass is woven in these small sheets and resin painted on it, smaller lighter things can be made.Fiberglass is fireproof. In case of accidents, users can get out of the car uninjured. It can be used in front bumpers, doors, roofs, casings, and the wheels.</p>

        <h2>4.Lead</h2>
        <p>Lead is an excellent metal because it is heavy and helps to balance the automobile. That is why most of the wheels are made of lead, aluminum, and parts of fiberglass. The battery is also made of lead, which allows it to maintain safe temperatures even when the car is heating up.</p>
    
        <h2>5.Copper</h2>
        <p>Copper is mostly used in wiring the car and any other electronic parts. The copper wires run throughout the car in different systems like the radio, safety systems, and charging points. It is also found in starters.</p>
    
        <h2>6.Titanium</h2>
        <p>Titanium is an expensive metal. This is why most companies refrain from using it in their manufacturing process since newer and cheaper methods of mining need to be developed.It mainly makes the cars look more aesthetically pleasing.</p>

        <h2>7.Magnesium</h2>
        <p>The body, structure, and some engine parts are made of magnesium.It is excellent because it is 75% lighter than steel and 33% lighter than aluminum. However, it is only used in small areas so as not to throw off the balance of the vehicles.</p>

        <h2>8.Glass</h2>
        <p>Currently, glass is used in navigation screens, back-up camera lenses, and mirrors in your car. It helps the driver have a clearer view of what they are doing and where they are going.The windshields are made of laminated glass. Glass lamination assures users of the highest safety levels, especially in the event of a crash.Lamination involves putting a thin layer of vinyl between two glasses. This ensures that there is not shutter when the glass is crushed.</p>
